HTML and CSS Project    

Here is a project that is meant to push you. Below we have screen shots of a web page we would like you to recreate.  It is expected that this project is going to take a lot of time so we are giving you two class days to complete it. You may need more time so make sure you work on it at home if that is necessary. Do your best messing around with different css attributes on how to style the web page. That is how you will learn best. If you feel stuck after trying your best feel free to ask questions. Your instructor is here to help.
